      "Janice: We were in the same congregation while in school. We knew each other, though from a distance. Our first picture together was after a Memorial observance- no butterflies, no sparks, just two people who loved Jehovah and shared mutual friends. Sometimes, we would walk together in the ministry. It was in one of those moments we found out Timothy shared the same names and initials as my dad, we had meaningful conversations that subtly planted the seeds of something deeper, neither of us knew it yet.",

We texted, exchanged calls often, during the holidays we would keep up with each other, encourage each other to study, go out in service, and talk about parts in the meetings we both enjoyed. Still, everything remained simply platonic. But in hindsight, something warm and comforting was already building- quietly, beautifully, without pressure.",

We talked about everything, family, goals, experiences at the ministry, articles we enjoyed reading, plans for the future, we would talk for hours. But what really brought us closer was when she lost her dad. Janice: Timothy was really present- he encouraged me, prayed with me, I never felt alone. I think that was when we both realized what started as a friendship had blossomed into something beautiful. We both wanted partners that loved Jehovah and it just seemed right at the time. Although we were miles apart, we were closer than ever. Daily calls, endless chats, laughter, support, we were growing fast.Timothy: When we finally reunited in school and had our first official date, everything fell in place. ",

But through every twist and turn, one thing stayed consistent, we wanted each other other as partners and we kept growing together.Timothy: And the proposal? Oh, she didn‚Äôt see it coming. It was everything we had hoped for calm, beautifully planned, and truly us.From that unforgettable moment to our engagement party with our friends, every step has brought us closer to our marriage.This is not just a new chapter, but a continuation of our beautiful journey, now, under the same roof, side by side, forever.",

             As single brothers back then, we worked side by side in the ministry winning soul for the Lord zealously and eloquently. As my roommates, back then in the BQ, we lived peacefully, a glimpse of how peaceful we will enjoy living together in paradise. Nothing do you my guy.
             
             I was super excited when it became official that it was Jayy. Then I knew I had done a good job behind the scenes of warming the feets against it becoming cold feet at its early stages, reassured when doubts crippled in. Jayy was indeed a fitted companion. She is an 'A1' grade material. Don't ask me how I know. I just know, I know. 
             Jayy and Timy are my people. They are both spiritual, articulated, educated, insightful and friendly. This was the right choice. Last Last We Go Dey Alright.

              As you prepare to walk down the aisle this August, I‚Äôve found myself reflecting deeply on the journey we‚Äôve shared over the last eight years. It‚Äôs hard to believe how far we‚Äôve come from two young students navigating the chaos of university life, to this moment of maturity, commitment, and love.
              You were my very first friend in university. In a place where everything was new and unfamiliar, your friendship felt like home. From day one, we connected over books, late-night classes, laughter, and mutual dreams. You weren‚Äôt just my friend; you became my reading partner, my night class buddy, and one of the few people who truly believed in me when things got tough.
              There‚Äôs something about studying with you that always makes learning easier. You had this way of explaining things, making sense out of confusion. Whether we were buried in textbooks or sneaking in jokes between chapters, you made studying feel like less of a chore and more of a shared mission. You encouraged me in ways that stuck. You always believed I could do more, be more and I‚Äôll never forget that.
              You‚Äôre the perfect mix of bad and good, the kind of bad that made life fun, spontaneous, and exciting, and the kind of good that made you dependable, honest, and principled. You were funny, always ready with a sarcastic comment or a perfectly timed joke. But beyond the laughter, you were also deeply disciplined. You knew when it was time to play, and when it was time to work. And I admired you for that balance. Oh, the memories we made. From sneaking away to the pool to cool off after long lectures, to laughing until our stomachs hurt. From sharing stress during exams to celebrating small victories with snacks and night walks. Our university days were golden, filled with a rhythm that only we understood. The blend of study and fun, of focus and freedom, made it all unforgettable. Those days were some of the best of my life, and you were a huge part of that. Now, as you step into this new chapter of your life, I just want to say how proud I am of the man you‚Äôve become. Love is no small thing, and marriage is one of the bravest, most beautiful commitments a person can make. Your bride is lucky she‚Äôs getting someone who‚Äôs loyal, thoughtful, strong, and real. 
              Timothy, may your marriage be filled with laughter as loud as our night class jokes, support as strong as our study bond, and love as deep as the friendship we built over these amazing years. I‚Äôm so grateful for everything we‚Äôve shared and all that lies ahead for you. Cheers to love, to beginnings, and to a lifetime of sweet memories yet to be made. Congratulations, my dear friend. You deserve all the happiness in the world.
              With all my heart,
              IFEANYI aka HYBRID ‚ú®
