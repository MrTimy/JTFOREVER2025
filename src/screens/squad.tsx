      "My friend, my brother Timy took a big bold decision to form a team, to be well complemented and helped to conquer and make more giant strides in life. Well done my guy. As single brothers back then, we worked side by side in the ministry winning soul for the Lord zealously and eloquently. As my roommates, back then in the BQ, we lived peacefully, a glimpse of how peaceful we will enjoy living together in paradise. Nothing do you my guy. I was super excited when it became official that it was Jayy. Then I knew I had done a good job behind the scenes of warming the feets against it becoming cold feet at its early stages, reassured when doubts crippled in. Jayy was indeed a fitted companion. She is an 'A1' grade material. Don't ask me how I know. I just know, I know. Jayy and Timy are my people. They are both spiritual, articulated, educated, insightful and friendly. This was the right choice. Last Last We Go Dey Alright.",

And Jah knows it really annoyed meüòÇ He quickly learned that I didn't like it, and we got along just fine..... Getting to know Timothy has been interesting. He is very energetic and can be a handful sometimes, but overall, when you are with him, you know it's all good vibes. My fondest memories come from our group hangouts. It's something I always look forward to, It's encouraging, and then we have the best times of our lives. I remember Timothy reaching out to tell me he was going to propose to Janiceüíï. We planned and planned, and I can tell you, I've never seen him so meticulous about any other thingüòÇ Janice is an absolute sweetheart, and I love the way she is his calm. Officially, Timothy has a competition because she has automatically taken his placeüòÇüòÇüòÇ. But then it's beautiful seeing them together. You can tell the genuine affection they have for each other. I wish them all the love, happiness, and blessings from Jehovah in their union. Congratulations.",

      "To Timothy My Friend, My Brother, My Day One. As you prepare to walk down the aisle this August, I've found myself reflecting deeply on the journey we've shared over the last eight years. It's hard to believe how far we've come from two young students navigating the chaos of university life, to this moment of maturity, commitment, and love. You were my very first friend in university. In a place where everything was new and unfamiliar, your friendship felt like home. From day one, we connected over books, late-night classes, laughter, and mutual dreams. You weren't just my friend; you became my reading partner, my night class buddy, and one of the few people who truly believed in me when things got tough. There's something about studying with you that always makes learning easier. You had this way of explaining things, making sense out of confusion. Whether we were buried in textbooks or sneaking in jokes between chapters, you made studying feel like less of a chore and more of a shared mission. You encouraged me in ways that stuck. You always believed I could do more, be more and I'll never forget that. You're the perfect mix of bad and good, the kind of bad that made life fun, spontaneous, and exciting, and the kind of good that made you dependable, honest, and principled. You were funny, always ready with a sarcastic comment or a perfectly timed joke. But beyond the laughter, you were also deeply disciplined. You knew when it was time to play, and when it was time to work. And I admired you for that balance. Oh, the memories we made. From sneaking away to the pool to cool off after long lectures, to laughing until our stomachs hurt. From sharing stress during exams to celebrating small victories with snacks and night walks. Our university days were golden, filled with a rhythm that only we understood. The blend of study and fun, of focus and freedom, made it all unforgettable. Those days were some of the best of my life, and you were a huge part of that. Now, as you step into this new chapter of your life, I just want to say how proud I am of the man you've become. Love is no small thing, and marriage is one of the bravest, most beautiful commitments a person can make. Your bride is lucky she's getting someone who's loyal, thoughtful, strong, and real. Timothy, may your marriage be filled with laughter as loud as our night class jokes, support as strong as our study bond, and love as deep as the friendship we built over these amazing years. I'm so grateful for everything we've shared and all that lies ahead for you. Cheers to love, to beginnings, and to a lifetime of sweet memories yet to be made. Congratulations, my dear friend. You deserve all the happiness in the world. With all my heart, IFEANYI aka HYBRID ‚ú®",

      "I got to know ‚ÄúTimoo‚Äù, as I fondly call him, sometime around 2017 during our undergrad days. I can‚Äôt recall the specifics of our first conversation, but one thing that always stands out about him besides his towering height, whenever and wherever you see him, is his penchant for looking debonair. My guy has a taste for good fashion and he always does his best to look his best. As I got to know him better through interactions at different places, mostly at the Kingdom Hall and occasionally on campus, I could feel his strong love for Jehovah and his sterling evangelizing spirit. His confident disposition, humorous nature, excellent leadership skills and alongside strong values and principles are also noteworthy. Lest I forget, he is also very diligent and highly ambitious. I strongly believe that whatever he sets his mind on, he has the grit, commitment, discipline alongside other necessary wherewithal to weather the storm and bring it to fruition. Our years of friendship have been amazing and filled with great moments and I am very happy he found an amazing partner and decided to take this giant step with her. It is my heartfelt desire that Jehovah, ‚Äúthe Giver of good gifts and perfect presents‚Äù pours out a floodgate of blessings on their beautiful union ‚Äúuntil there is nothing¬†lacking‚Äù.ur love, support, and friendship mean the world.

From classroom corridors to late-night campus gist sessions, he's been there through it all. A standout moment with Jay was in 2019, when she and some friends pulled off a surprise celebration for Obed after his final exam, a simple act that showed just how thoughtful and easygoing she is. Jay has a gentle grace about her, the kind that quietly lifts those around her. Now Tim‚Ä¶ Well, let's just say subtlety is not his spiritual gift. Loud, hilarious, unapologetically himself, and blessed with the rare ability to make even bad news sound like a party announcement, Schoolmates, colleagues, brothers-in-faith there's no shortage of memories there. Seeing the two of them together feels like watching your favorite playlist come to life: a perfect mix of soul and rhythm, calm and chaos. They're totally made for each other.

Funny man, eating and chilling when we were headed for a serious business meeting. And don't you forget that you are a picture freak. Always disturbing me with 'Custa, please give me a shot'. Meanwhile, try to ask me how to pronounce that name well. Socially, you have a vibe. A good stepper, not shy to dance in any public setting.

Timothy, always ready to gist, jab at you, throw jokes and enjoy the moment. Of course only someone who gets sarcasm and enjoys being jolly will get Timothy, and Janice filled those shoes. Timothy has shown admirable spiritual growth, and with as simple as a dress choice Janice demonstrated her consciousness in her relationship with Jehovah. Now what better match than two people who considers Jehovah in all they do. I wish this union brings the best out of both of you as you work life together.

Fast forward to a year later, I met Janice who was not just in my congregation but also in my department. We became close because we had similar traits, and could easily relate to situations as first daughters. She became my friend, baby girl and colleague. Over the years, we've all grown in the same space, in different spaces, and I've watched them nurture their love for each other and extend that love to others. For instance, when Janice and I lost very important people to us within a space of 3 months or so, the soon-to-be couple extended condolence and comfort to me by praying with me over the phone and encouraging me. An act I won't forget. Timo, my guy and Janice, my babygirl, I pray that Jehovah bless your union as you put him first in this everlasting bond. I also pray for joy, happiness, and wisdom.
